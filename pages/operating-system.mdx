## Operating System

In this chapter, we will delve into the world of operating systems. This chapter is primarily based on the book [**Operating System Concepts**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_System_Concepts), affectionately known as "the dinosaur book" in the computer science community.

### What to Expect

We will start with an introduction to understand what an operating system is and its fundamental role in computing. Then, we will explore various critical topics, including:

- **Computer System Architecture**: Understanding the hardware-software interface.
- **Operating System Structure**: The overall design and components of an OS.
- **Processes**: The lifecycle, management, and synchronization of processes.
- **Deadlock**: Causes, prevention, and resolution strategies.
- **Process Synchronization**: Techniques to handle concurrent processes.
- **Memory Management**: Allocation, management, and optimization of memory.
- **Storage Management**: Managing disk space and other storage resources.
- **File Systems**: Organization, access, and management of data on storage devices.

Let's get started on this fascinating journey into operating systems!
