## Computer Organization and Architecture

In this chapter, we will delve into the essential concepts of computer organization and architecture, using the book [**Computer Organization and Design MIPS Edition**](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Organization-Design-MIPS-Architecture/dp/0124077269) by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy as our primary guide.
