## Overview

**CS Book** is organized into six primary subjects, each essential for a solid foundation in computer science. Below is a brief overview of what you can expect in each section.

### Ask Yourself These Questions Before You Start

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is your goal?</strong></summary>
  Are you preparing for a computer science entrance exam, or are you learning computer science for the first time? We suggest you set a clear goal before you start.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is your current level?</strong></summary>
  Do you have a basic understanding of computer science concepts, or are you starting from scratch? Knowing your current level will help you choose the right resources and study plan. We recommend you have a basic understanding of computer science concepts before diving into this book.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is your learning style?</strong></summary>
  Do you prefer reading books, watching videos, or learning by doing? We provide a variety of resources, including books, online courses, and videos, to cater to different learning styles. We also offer interactive examples and exercises to help you learn by doing.
</details>

If you are preparing for a computer science exam, have basic knowledge, and prefer a concise and straightforward guide with hands-on examples, this book is for you.

### The Design of This Book

For each chapter of each subject, we will follow this structure:

1. **Overview**: A brief introduction and its importance, so you know what to expect and focus on.
2. **No Boring Stuff**: We will skip the boring stuff and go straight to examples and exercises to get to the core concepts.
3. **Hands-on Examples**: We will provide hands-on examples and exercises to help you understand the concepts better.
4. **Quick Summary**: A quick summary of the key points and takeaways to help you review and remember the concepts.

I believe **Example-Based Learning** is the most effective way in this field. Follow along with the examples and exercises, and you will be well on your way to mastering computer science.
