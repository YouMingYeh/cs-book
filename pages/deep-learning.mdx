# Deep Learning

Deep Learning
In this chapter, we will learn about deep learning from the ground up using Professor HUNG-YI LEE's [2023 Machine Learning course materials](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/ml/2023-spring.php) and frontier research papers. 

We will cover topics such as convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and their applications in different fields. We will also discuss state-of-the-art research, such as LLM (Large Language Model) alignment and security.

You are expected to have basic knowledge of Python, calculus, and probability.
