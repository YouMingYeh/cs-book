## Introduction

**CS Book** is a collection of notes and resources for students learning computer science.

I am a third-year student at National Taiwan University, majoring in Information Management and preparing for the Computer Science Entrance Exams for Master's Degree Programs. The purposes of this book are:

1. To help me review and take notes while preparing for the entrance exams.
2. To assist others in preparing for CS graduate exams or learning computer science through online resources.

This book currently focuses on six primary subjects: **Algorithms, Data Structures, Operating Systems, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, and Computer Organization**. 

>Please note that this book is not a 0 to 1 guide. We will go straight to the point and get to the core concepts ASAP. If you are looking for a comprehensive guide to learning computer science from scratch, this book might not be the best fit for you.

### Why I Created This Book

1. **Personal Review**: To review knowledge and prepare for entrance exams for master's degree programs.
2. **Sharing Knowledge**: To share notes and resources with others preparing for exams.
3. **Learning in Public**: To receive feedback and improve understanding by sharing notes publicly.

### How to Use This Book

Use the sidebar to navigate through the book or the search bar (cmd+k) to find specific topics.

This book is completely free and open-source. You can help improve it by contributing using the "Edit this page" button at the right of each page.

Again, please note that this book might not be suitable for learning computer science from scratch. It is more like a cheat sheet for those who already have fundamental knowledge.
